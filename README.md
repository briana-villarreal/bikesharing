# Bikesharing with NYC Citibike Data
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City to present findings to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. I aimed to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
## Results
### Visualizations 
The following visualization displays customer type. For NYC Citibike, there are 1,900,359 subscribers and 443,865 customers. This information can help inform the customer base for Iowa.

The following visualization displays the top starting locations for the users of Citibike in NYC. The starting location that was the most concentrated was central Manhattan, suggesting that major metropolitan areas in Iowa will similarly have the most user traffic.

The following visualization displays the number of trips by duration. Most Citibike users take trips that are under an hour in length. This can help inform bike usage times for Iowa.

The following visualization breaksdown the number of rides by duration separated by gender. For NYC, more rides were taken by male-identifying customers. This can help investors in Iowa know who to target marketing campaigns towards.

The following visualization shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. Most trips are taken between 5 and 7 pm in New York. This finding can be applied in Iowa.

The following visualization graphs the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap. It shows that male identifying riders use Citibike more frequently at most hours of the day than femal identifying riders.

The following visualization shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by
 Usertype. It shows that male subscribers take the most bike trips than other users.

## Summary
### Findings
Citibike services are popular in busy metropolitan areas. The services are most popular among male customers, specifically male subscribers. The main hours of bike usage center around evening commute times.
### Suggested Visualizations 
Given the data, I would suggest two additional visualizations for future analysis. One visualization I would make would assess starting and ending locations of trips taken between 5 and 7 pm to see how traffic flows between neighborhoods at peak hours. Another visualization I would make would show average trip duration by birth year and gender as this would determine the differences in trip length taken by different aged and gendered customers. 
## Errors
I am unable to attatch a link to my Tableau public account. I had to redo the challenge several times as I kept getting the error below. Therefore, I have simply included screenshots of my work (from my local Tableau) for the challenge. I can attempt to add my story to the public account once more, however, I have been unable to remedy this issue at the present time. I do not have an extract button on my end so I am unable to extract data as it is asking me to. I apologize for this inconvenience.
